# Python Indentation
# Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of 
# a code line.

# Where in other programming languages the indentation 
# in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code


 


# Python Comments
# Comments can be used to explain Python code.
# Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
# Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.



# Creating a Comment
# Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:





"""Multi Line Comments
Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.

To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:
Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, 
you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
""" """
